<H1>Super Robo Rally</H1>
<p>Imagine that you're a supercomputer. Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you 
and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the 
factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that 
the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various 
locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real 
fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...</p>

<p>Super Robo Rally is a game set in a Plastic Widget factory where players program robots to move around the 
factory floor using simple move commands, in a race to maintain control of the central processing core indicated by the red square</p>
